# 🏬 Mall Customer Segmentation Dashboard (Tableau)

This project analyzes mall customers based on their demographics, annual income, and spending behavior using an interactive Tableau dashboard.  
It helps identify distinct customer segments and provides insights into spending patterns, gender distribution, and income groups.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes:
- **Gender Distribution** (Pie Chart) — visualizes the ratio of male to female customers.  
- **Income vs Spending Score** (Scatter Plot) — identifies customer clusters based on income and spending behavior.  
- **Customer Segments** (Bar Chart) — groups customers as *High, Medium,* or *Low* based on their spending.  
- **KPI Cards** — show total customers, average annual income, and average spending score.  
- **Filters** — interactive filters for Gender, Age, and Income range.
